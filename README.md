Data Profiling:

Objective: Data profiling is the process of examining and summarizing the characteristics of data. It involves gathering metadata and statistical information about a dataset without actually analyzing the data's content.
Key Activities:
Identifying data types (e.g., text, numbers, dates).
Calculating summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
Detecting missing values, unique values, and duplicates.
Assessing data quality and data distribution.
Purpose: Data profiling helps in understanding the structure, quality, and content of data. It is typically the first step in data analysis and data preparation.


Data Mining:

Objective: Data mining is the process of discovering hidden patterns, trends, or knowledge from large datasets using statistical, mathematical, and machine learning techniques.
Key Activities:
Identifying patterns, correlations, and associations in data.
Building predictive models to make future predictions.
Clustering data to find groups or segments.
Classification and regression analysis.
Purpose: Data mining is used to extract valuable insights, make predictions, and inform decision-making. It is often used for tasks such as market analysis, fraud detection, and recommendation systems.


Data Cleaning:

Objective: Data cleaning (or data cleansing) is the process of identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in a dataset to improve data quality.
Key Activities:
Handling missing values by imputation or removal.
Correcting inaccuracies, such as typos or outliers.
Standardizing data formats and units.
Ensuring data consistency and integrity.
Purpose: Data cleaning aims to ensure that the data is accurate, reliable, and suitable for analysis. Clean data is essential for accurate modeling and meaningful insights.
